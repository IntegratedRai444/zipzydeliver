📦 Zipzy – Full Detailed Specification
📝 What is Zipzy?

Zipzy is a remote campus delivery app designed specifically for colleges and universities. Its goal is to provide students and staff with a quick way to order food, stationery, essentials, or digital services and get them delivered within the campus.

It solves the problem that most colleges don’t have dedicated delivery apps, unlike cities that already have Zomato, Blinkit, or Zepto.
