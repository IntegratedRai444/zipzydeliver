Perfect 👌 Let’s deep dive into the **Inbox System for Zipzy** (the communication part).

The idea is:
👉 A **temporary chat system** that only opens when an order is active and **closes automatically once the order is delivered**.

---

### **Inbox System Design**

#### **Database Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  order_id UUID REFERENCES orders(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  sender_id UUID NOT NULL,
  receiver_id UUID NOT NULL,
  message TEXT NOT NULL,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

* Each chat message is tied to an **order\_id**.
* `sender_id` = user or partner.
* `receiver_id` = the other side.

---

#### **API Endpoints**

1. **Send Message**

```http
POST /messages
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "order_id": "uuid-of-order",
  "sender_id": "uuid-of-sender",
  "receiver_id": "uuid-of-receiver",
  "message": "Where is my order?"
}
```

➡️ Saves the message in DB only if the **order status != DELIVERED**.
If order is delivered → reject with `403 Chat Closed`.

---

2. **Fetch Messages**

```http
GET /messages/:order_id
```

Returns all messages related to that order:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "msg-uuid",
    "sender_id": "user-uuid",
    "receiver_id": "partner-uuid",
    "message": "Order confirmed!",
    "sent_at": "2025-08-27T09:15:00Z"
  }
]
```

---

3. **Chat Auto-Close Rule**
   When `orders.status = 'DELIVERED'`, messages cannot be sent anymore.

* The history can be fetched (for reference).
* New `POST /messages` → blocked.

---

### **Frontend Behavior (if added later)**

* When user opens “Order Details” → an **Inbox button** appears.
* Clicking it opens chat (like WhatsApp inside the app).
* After delivery, the button is disabled → “Chat Closed ✅ Order Delivered.”

---

⚡ This way, **communication is strictly linked to the lifecycle of an order**.

Do you want me to now **write the actual Express.js API code** for this inbox system so you can plug it into your ordering backend?
